## **Complete JavaScript Topics for Senior JavaScript Developer (SDE-1 & SDE-2)**

### **Core JavaScript Fundamentals**

**Variables and Data Types**[1](https://blog.stackademic.com/comprehensive-guide-to-javascript-interview-prep-questions-to-ace-your-sde2-role-in-2025-8c0aeb331499)
Understanding primitive types (string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, bigint) and reference types (objects, arrays, functions) is foundational. Master the difference between pass-by-value and pass-by-reference, as this impacts how data is manipulated.[2](https://codesignal.com/blog/25-javascript-interview-questions-and-answers-from-basic-to-senior-level/)[1](https://blog.stackademic.com/comprehensive-guide-to-javascript-interview-prep-questions-to-ace-your-sde2-role-in-2025-8c0aeb331499)

**Scope and Execution Context**[3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/7-javascript-concepts-that-every-developer-must-know/)[4](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/advanced-javascript-concepts/)
Grasp the nuances of global scope, function scope, and block scope introduced with ES6's `let` and `const`. Understanding lexical scope, scope chain, and how execution contexts are created and managed is critical for debugging and writing efficient code.[4](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/advanced-javascript-concepts/)[5](https://www.suntecindia.com/blog/exciting-new-javascript-concepts-you-need-to-know/)

**Hoisting**[5](https://www.suntecindia.com/blog/exciting-new-javascript-concepts-you-need-to-know/)[3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/7-javascript-concepts-that-every-developer-must-know/)
Know how variable and function declarations are hoisted to the top of their scope during the compilation phase. This includes understanding the differences in hoisting behavior between `var`, `let`, `const`, and function declarations.[3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/7-javascript-concepts-that-every-developer-must-know/)

**Closures**[6](https://engx.space/global/en/blog/senior-javascript-developer-interview-questions)[7][8][9]
Closures are fundamental to JavaScript's functional programming capabilities. They allow inner functions to access variables from outer functions even after the outer function has executed, enabling powerful patterns like data encapsulation, private variables, and function factories.[7][8][9]

**The `this` Keyword**[4](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/advanced-javascript-concepts/)[5](https://www.suntecindia.com/blog/exciting-new-javascript-concepts-you-need-to-know/)
Master how `this` behaves in different contexts: global context, object methods, constructors, arrow functions, and with explicit binding using `call()`, `apply()`, and `bind()`.[5](https://www.suntecindia.com/blog/exciting-new-javascript-concepts-you-need-to-know/)[4](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/advanced-javascript-concepts/)

**Prototypes and Prototypal Inheritance**[10][4](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/advanced-javascript-concepts/)[5](https://www.suntecindia.com/blog/exciting-new-javascript-concepts-you-need-to-know/)
JavaScript uses prototypal inheritance rather than classical inheritance. Every object has a prototype from which it inherits properties and methods. Understanding the prototype chain, `Object.create()`, and how ES6 classes work under the hood is essential.[10]

### **Asynchronous JavaScript**

**Callbacks**[6](https://engx.space/global/en/blog/senior-javascript-developer-interview-questions)[3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/7-javascript-concepts-that-every-developer-must-know/)
The original method for handling asynchronous operations. While callbacks are essential, understanding callback hell and how to avoid it is equally important.[3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/7-javascript-concepts-that-every-developer-must-know/)[6](https://engx.space/global/en/blog/senior-javascript-developer-interview-questions)

**Promises**[9][7][6](https://engx.space/global/en/blog/senior-javascript-developer-interview-questions)[3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/7-javascript-concepts-that-every-developer-must-know/)
Promises provide a cleaner way to handle asynchronous operations with `.then()`, `.catch()`, and `.finally()` methods. Understanding promise chaining, error handling, and `Promise.all()`, `Promise.race()`, `Promise.allSettled()`, and the new ES2025 `Promise.try()` is crucial.[11][7][9]

**Async/Await**[7][9][6](https://engx.space/global/en/blog/senior-javascript-developer-interview-questions)[10]
This syntactic sugar built on promises makes asynchronous code look synchronous, improving readability and maintainability. Master error handling with try-catch blocks in async functions.[6](https://engx.space/global/en/blog/senior-javascript-developer-interview-questions)[7][10]

**Event Loop and Callback Queue**[4](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/advanced-javascript-concepts/)[10]
Understanding JavaScript's single-threaded, non-blocking I/O model is fundamental. Know how the call stack, callback queue (task queue), and microtask queue interact, and how the event loop orchestrates their execution.[10][4](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/advanced-javascript-concepts/)

### **Advanced JavaScript Concepts**

**Destructuring**[5](https://www.suntecindia.com/blog/exciting-new-javascript-concepts-you-need-to-know/)
ES6 introduced powerful destructuring syntax for arrays and objects, making code more concise and readable.[5](https://www.suntecindia.com/blog/exciting-new-javascript-concepts-you-need-to-know/)

**Spread and Rest Operators**[5](https://www.suntecindia.com/blog/exciting-new-javascript-concepts-you-need-to-know/)
The spread operator (`...`) expands arrays and objects, while the rest operator collects multiple elements into an array. Both are essential for modern JavaScript development.[5](https://www.suntecindia.com/blog/exciting-new-javascript-concepts-you-need-to-know/)

**Higher-Order Functions**[12][13][4](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/advanced-javascript-concepts/)
Functions that take other functions as arguments or return functions as results. Essential array methods like `map()`, `filter()`, `reduce()`, `forEach()`, `some()`, and `every()` are higher-order functions.[13][12]

**IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression)**[3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/7-javascript-concepts-that-every-developer-must-know/)[5](https://www.suntecindia.com/blog/exciting-new-javascript-concepts-you-need-to-know/)
A function that executes immediately after definition, useful for creating isolated scopes and avoiding global namespace pollution.[3](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/javascript/7-javascript-concepts-that-every-developer-must-know/)[5](https://www.suntecindia.com/blog/exciting-new-javascript-concepts-you-need-to-know/)

**Currying and Partial Application**[12][4](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/advanced-javascript-concepts/)
Advanced functional programming techniques where functions are transformed to accept arguments one at a time (currying) or with some arguments pre-filled (partial application).[12][4](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/advanced-javascript-concepts/)

**Memoization**[4](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/advanced-javascript-concepts/)[12]
A performance optimization technique that caches function results based on input parameters, preventing redundant calculations.[12][4](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/advanced-javascript-concepts/)

**Composition and Pipe**[4](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/advanced-javascript-concepts/)[12]
Function composition combines multiple functions into one, enabling cleaner and more maintainable code. Understanding how to compose functions is key to functional programming.[12][4](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/advanced-javascript-concepts/)

### **Functional Programming in JavaScript**

**Pure Functions**[14][15][12]
Functions that always return the same output for the same input and have no side effects. Pure functions are easier to test, debug, and reason about.[15][14][12]

**Immutability**[14][4](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/advanced-javascript-concepts/)[12]
Working with immutable data structures prevents unintended mutations and makes code more predictable. Use techniques like spreading, `Object.freeze()`, and libraries like Immer for managing immutable state.[14][12]

**First-Class Functions**[13][4](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/advanced-javascript-concepts/)
In JavaScript, functions are first-class citizens, meaning they can be assigned to variables, passed as arguments, and returned from other functions.[13][4](https://zerotomastery.io/courses/advanced-javascript-concepts/)

**Declarative vs Imperative Programming**[14][12]
Understand the difference between telling the computer what you want (declarative) versus how to do it (imperative).[14][12]

### **ES6+ Modern JavaScript Features**

**Arrow Functions**[7]

**Modules (Import/Export)**[16][17][18]
ES6 modules use `import` and `export` statements for modular code organization. Understanding the difference between ES modules and CommonJS is crucial for modern development.[17][18][16]

**Classes**[10]
ES6 class syntax provides a cleaner way to create constructor functions and handle inheritance, though it's syntactic sugar over prototypal inheritance.[10]

**Symbols and BigInt**[1](https://blog.stackademic.com/comprehensive-guide-to-javascript-interview-prep-questions-to-ace-your-sde2-role-in-2025-8c0aeb331499)
New primitive types introduced in ES6 and ES11 respectively for unique property keys and arbitrary-precision integers.[1](https://blog.stackademic.com/comprehensive-guide-to-javascript-interview-prep-questions-to-ace-your-sde2-role-in-2025-8c0aeb331499)

**Optional Chaining (`?.`)**[19]
Safely access deeply nested properties without checking each level for null/undefined.[19]

**Nullish Coalescing Operator (`??`)**[20]
Provides default values only for null or undefined, unlike `||` which treats all falsy values the same[20].

**Logical Assignment Operators**[20]
`||=`, `&&=`, and `??=` provide shorthand for conditional assignments[20].

### **ES2024 & ES2025 New Features**

**Set Methods**[11]
New set operations like `union()`, `intersection()`, `difference()`, `symmetricDifference()`, `isSubsetOf()`, `isSupersetOf()`, and `isDisjointFrom()`.[11]

## Answers

# Mastering JavaScript Scope (In Depth)

Understanding scope is key to writing bug-free, predictable JavaScript. Scope answers: “Where is a variable visible and accessible?”

## 1) What is scope?

- Scope is the current execution context that controls variable visibility. A variable is only accessible inside its scope and its inner scopes.[1]
- JavaScript uses lexical (static) scoping: scope is determined by where code is written (not where it’s called).[2]

Quick check: Can you explain in one sentence how lexical scoping decides variable access?

## 2) Kinds of scope in JS

- Global scope: defined at the top level; accessible everywhere (modules change details—see below).
- Function scope: variables declared inside a function are visible only inside it and inner functions.[3]
- Block scope: `let`, `const`, and `class` create variables scoped to `{ ... }` blocks (e.g., `if`, `for`).[4][5]

Mini-quiz: Which are block-scoped: var, let, const? Why might that matter in a for-loop with closures?

## 3) Declarations and visibility

- `var` is function-scoped; ignores blocks; attaches to the nearest function scope (or global if none).
- `let`/`const` are block-scoped; exist in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) from block start until the declaration line—accessing them early throws ReferenceError.[5][4]
- Function declarations are hoisted and initialized before execution (within their scope), so they can be called earlier in the same scope.[6][3]

Try it: Predict what happens when you log a `let` variable before its declaration inside a block, then run and explain the error.

## 4) Hoisting vs TDZ

- Hoisting: declarations are moved to the top of their scope conceptually; `var` becomes defined as `undefined` during creation; functions become callable.[6]
- TDZ: `let`/`const` are hoisted but uninitialized until their declaration executes; accessing them in the TDZ throws.[4][5]

Memory tip: “var floats, let/const wait.”

## 5) Scope chain and lexical environment

- Each scope has a Lexical Environment with an environment record (bindings) and a reference to an outer environment—this forms the scope chain.[7][3]
- When resolving an identifier, JS looks in the current environment, then walks outward until the global environment (or module/global scope).[7]

Check: If an inner function references a name that doesn’t exist locally, where does JavaScript look next—and when does it stop?[7]

## 6) Closures (scope that outlives its creator)

- A closure is a function bundled with references to its outer lexical environment; it lets inner functions access variables of outer functions even after the outer function returns.[8][2]
- Closures power patterns like data privacy, function factories, memoization, and event handlers.

Example pattern:

```js
function makeCounter(start = 0) {
  let count = start; // captured by the closure
  return function next() {
    count += 1;
    return count;
  };
}
const c1 = makeCounter(5);
console.log(c1()); // 6
console.log(c1()); // 7
```

Why it works: `next` closes over `count` via the lexical environment created when `makeCounter` ran.[9][8]

You try: Rewrite this using an IIFE to create a private `count` without returning a factory.

## 7) Module scope vs script scope

- In ES modules (`<script type="module">` or `.mjs`/`import`), top-level variables are module-scoped, not attached to `window`; each module has its own scope and its own top-level `this` (undefined).[7]
- In classic scripts, top-level `var` creates a property on the global object; `let`/`const` do not.

Question: In a browser module, is `topLevelVar` accessible via `window.topLevelVar`?

## 8) Block scope pitfalls and patterns

- For-loops: `let i` creates a new `i` binding per iteration—great for closures in event handlers; `var i` shares one binding (classic bug).
- Shadowing: an inner variable with the same name hides an outer one. Prefer clear naming to avoid confusion.
- Dead zones: Avoid accessing `let`/`const` before declaration—even inside the same block—to prevent TDZ errors.[5][4]

Practice: Convert a `var` loop with click handlers to `let`, and explain why handlers now get the right index.

## 9) The role of `this` (not scope, but often confused)

- `this` depends on call-site (regular functions) or is lexically bound (arrow functions). It’s not determined by lexical scope. Understand `call/apply/bind` vs arrow behavior. Keep `this` conceptually separate from scope.

Check: In an arrow function used as a method, where does `this` come from?

## 10) Execution context and the event loop (why this matters)

- Execution contexts (global, function, eval) hold the Lexical Environment; contexts push/pop on the call stack as functions run.[7]
- Understanding contexts clarifies hoisting, TDZ, and closures, and how async callbacks run after the current turn completes (event loop and job queues).[7]

Reflect: How does a pending microtask (e.g., `promise.then`) interact with variables it closes over?

---

## Quick mastery checklist

- I can explain global, function, and block scope in one minute.
- I can predict hoisting for `var`, `let`, `const`, and functions on any snippet.[4][6][5]
- I can implement a function factory that maintains private state via closures.[8][2]
- I can debug TDZ and shadowing bugs.
- I know the difference between module scope and script scope.[7]

## One-step practice (your turn)

1. What does this print, and why?

```js
console.log(typeof a);
let a = 1;
```

Answer verbally first; then run it and reconcile with TDZ rules.

2. Fix the classic bug:

```js
const buttons = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll("button"));
for (var i = 0; i < buttons.length; i++) {
  buttons[i].addEventListener("click", () => console.log(i));
}
```

Change it so each click logs its own index. Explain the mechanism.

3. Closure warm-up:

```js
function once(fn) {
  let called = false,
    value;
  return function (...args) {
    if (!called) {
      called = true;
      value = fn.apply(this, args);
    }
    return value;
  };
}

```

Lexical scoping: rule. It’s the rule that variable visibility is determined by where code is written (the definition site), forming a scope chain from inner to outer scopes.

Closure: mechanism. It’s the mechanism where a function carries references to its defining lexical environment so it can access those variables later, even after the outer function has returned.
