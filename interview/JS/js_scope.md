# Mastering JavaScript Scope (In Depth)

Understanding scope is key to writing bug-free, predictable JavaScript. Scope answers: “Where is a variable visible and accessible?”

## 1) What is scope?

- Scope is the current execution context that controls variable visibility. A variable is only accessible inside its scope and its inner scopes.[1]
- JavaScript uses lexical (static) scoping: scope is determined by where code is written (not where it’s called).[2]

Quick check: Can you explain in one sentence how lexical scoping decides variable access?

## 2) Kinds of scope in JS

- Global scope: defined at the top level; accessible everywhere (modules change details—see below).
- Function scope: variables declared inside a function are visible only inside it and inner functions.[3]
- Block scope: `let`, `const`, and `class` create variables scoped to `{ ... }` blocks (e.g., `if`, `for`).[4][5]

Mini-quiz: Which are block-scoped: var, let, const? Why might that matter in a for-loop with closures?

## 3) Declarations and visibility

- `var` is function-scoped; ignores blocks; attaches to the nearest function scope (or global if none).
- `let`/`const` are block-scoped; exist in the Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) from block start until the declaration line—accessing them early throws ReferenceError.[5][4]
- Function declarations are hoisted and initialized before execution (within their scope), so they can be called earlier in the same scope.[6][3]

Try it: Predict what happens when you log a `let` variable before its declaration inside a block, then run and explain the error.

## 4) Hoisting vs TDZ

- Hoisting: declarations are moved to the top of their scope conceptually; `var` becomes defined as `undefined` during creation; functions become callable.[6]
- TDZ: `let`/`const` are hoisted but uninitialized until their declaration executes; accessing them in the TDZ throws.[4][5]

Memory tip: “var floats, let/const wait.”

## 5) Scope chain and lexical environment

- Each scope has a Lexical Environment with an environment record (bindings) and a reference to an outer environment—this forms the scope chain.[7][3]
- When resolving an identifier, JS looks in the current environment, then walks outward until the global environment (or module/global scope).[7]

Check: If an inner function references a name that doesn’t exist locally, where does JavaScript look next—and when does it stop?[7]

## 6) Closures (scope that outlives its creator)

- A closure is a function bundled with references to its outer lexical environment; it lets inner functions access variables of outer functions even after the outer function returns.[8][2]
- Closures power patterns like data privacy, function factories, memoization, and event handlers.

Example pattern:

```js
function makeCounter(start = 0) {
  let count = start; // captured by the closure
  return function next() {
    count += 1;
    return count;
  };
}
const c1 = makeCounter(5);
console.log(c1()); // 6
console.log(c1()); // 7
```

Why it works: `next` closes over `count` via the lexical environment created when `makeCounter` ran.[9][8]

You try: Rewrite this using an IIFE to create a private `count` without returning a factory.

## 7) Module scope vs script scope

- In ES modules (`<script type="module">` or `.mjs`/`import`), top-level variables are module-scoped, not attached to `window`; each module has its own scope and its own top-level `this` (undefined).[7]
- In classic scripts, top-level `var` creates a property on the global object; `let`/`const` do not.

Question: In a browser module, is `topLevelVar` accessible via `window.topLevelVar`?

## 8) Block scope pitfalls and patterns

- For-loops: `let i` creates a new `i` binding per iteration—great for closures in event handlers; `var i` shares one binding (classic bug).
- Shadowing: an inner variable with the same name hides an outer one. Prefer clear naming to avoid confusion.
- Dead zones: Avoid accessing `let`/`const` before declaration—even inside the same block—to prevent TDZ errors.[5][4]

Practice: Convert a `var` loop with click handlers to `let`, and explain why handlers now get the right index.

## 9) The role of `this` (not scope, but often confused)

- `this` depends on call-site (regular functions) or is lexically bound (arrow functions). It’s not determined by lexical scope. Understand `call/apply/bind` vs arrow behavior. Keep `this` conceptually separate from scope.

Check: In an arrow function used as a method, where does `this` come from?

## 10) Execution context and the event loop (why this matters)

- Execution contexts (global, function, eval) hold the Lexical Environment; contexts push/pop on the call stack as functions run.[7]
- Understanding contexts clarifies hoisting, TDZ, and closures, and how async callbacks run after the current turn completes (event loop and job queues).[7]

Reflect: How does a pending microtask (e.g., `promise.then`) interact with variables it closes over?

## Quick mastery checklist

- I can explain global, function, and block scope in one minute.
- I can predict hoisting for `var`, `let`, `const`, and functions on any snippet.[4][6][5]
- I can implement a function factory that maintains private state via closures.[8][2]
- I can debug TDZ and shadowing bugs.
- I know the difference between module scope and script scope.[7]

## One-step practice (your turn)

1. What does this print, and why?

```js
console.log(typeof a);
let a = 1;
```

Answer verbally first; then run it and reconcile with TDZ rules.

2. Fix the classic bug:

```js
const buttons = Array.from(document.querySelectorAll("button"));
for (var i = 0; i < buttons.length; i++) {
  buttons[i].addEventListener("click", () => console.log(i));
}
```

Change it so each click logs its own index. Explain the mechanism.

3. Closure warm-up:

```js
function once(fn) {
  let called = false,
    value;
  return function (...args) {
    if (!called) {
      called = true;
      value = fn.apply(this, args);
    }
    return value;
  };
}

```

Lexical scoping: rule. It’s the rule that variable visibility is determined by where code is written (the definition site), forming a scope chain from inner to outer scopes.

Closure: mechanism. It’s the mechanism where a function carries references to its defining lexical environment so it can access those variables later, even after the outer function has returned.
