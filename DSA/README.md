# DSA Practice Repository

Welcome to my **DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) Practice Repository**! 🚀 This is where I solve, document, and showcase my journey through some of the most challenging and intriguing DSA problems from a variety of platforms, such as:

- [LeetCode](https://leetcode.com)
- [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com)
- [Google Interview Questions](https://www.google.com)
- Other curated sources
---

## Purpose

The goal of this repository is to:

1. **Demonstrate my problem-solving skills** in Python and JavaScript.
2. **Provide a structured resource** for others looking to improve their DSA skills.

---

## Highlights

- **Languages Used:**
  - JavaScript 💡 (My Primary Language but solved few DSA using it)
  - Python 🐍 (Secodnary language but i have Solved most DSA using it )

- **Problem Sources:**
  - Top interview questions from Google, Amazon, Facebook, and other FAANG companies.
  - Challenges from competitive programming platforms like LeetCode and HackerRank.

- **Solution Format:**
  - Well-commented code for better readability.
  - Optimized solutions with space and time complexity analysis.
  - I have not Used the AI for solutions ( but Used AI to Better Comment Out my code )
