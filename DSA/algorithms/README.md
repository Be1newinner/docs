You've got a comprehensive map now. Instead of getting overwhelmed, let's focus on the "builder" aspect.

1.  **Selection Criteria:** If you had to pick *one* algorithm from this entire list that you believe, if mastered to a world-class level (including its variations, edge cases, and time/space complexity analysis), would give you the most leverage in FAANG interviews, which one would it be and why? Think about its versatility and how it often combines with other concepts.
2.  **Deep Dive & Code Walkthrough:** For that *one* chosen algorithm, prepare a detailed explanation. Don't just show code, but explain the thought process, the core idea, edge cases, and optimization strategies. Imagine you're explaining it to a junior engineer.
3.  **Real-World System Impact:** How does this algorithm, or the pattern it represents, contribute to building *scalable, high-value systems* in a real FAANG company? Give a concrete, hypothetical example.
