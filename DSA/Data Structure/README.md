## Core Data Structures to Master

### 1. Linear DS

1. **Arrays/Lists**
   - Operations: Traversal, Insertion, Deletion, Rotation
   - Sliding Window, Two-pointer techniques
   - Examples: Subarray problems, Kadane’s Algorithm

2. **Strings**
   - Palindrome checks, Anagrams
   - Pattern Matching (e.g., KMP, Rabin-Karp)
   - String Compression/Decompression

3. **Linked Lists**
   - Singly and Doubly Linked Lists
   - Operations: Reversing, Merging, Sorting
   - Examples: Cycle detection, Intersection of lists

4. **Stacks and Queues**
   - Implementation using lists or collections
   - Monotonic Stack/Queue problems
   - Applications: Next Greater Element, BFS

5. **Hashing**
   - Hash Tables, Hash Maps
   - Collision handling techniques
   - Use cases: Subarray with given sum, Group anagrams


### 2. Non Linear DS

1. **Trees**
   - Binary Trees, Binary Search Trees (BSTs)
   - Tree Traversals: In-order, Pre-order, Post-order
   - Advanced: Trie, Segment Tree, Fenwick Tree

2. **Heaps**
   - Min-Heap and Max-Heap (Priority Queues)
   - Applications: Median of Data Stream, Top K Elements

3. **Graphs**
   - Representations: Adjacency Matrix/List
   - Traversals: BFS, DFS
   - Algorithms: Dijkstra’s, Kruskal’s, Prim’s, Topological Sorting

4. **Trie (Prefix Tree)**

5. **Disjoint Set (Union-Find)**

### **Dynamic Programming**
   - Basic patterns: Knapsack, LCS, LIS
   - Advanced: Matrix Chain Multiplication, DP on Trees

### **Miscellaneous**
   - Bit Manipulation
   - Union-Find (Disjoint Set)
   - Sliding Window and Two-pointer algorithms

### Action Plan
1. **Foundational Understanding**  
   - Start with Python-specific implementation for each data structure. 
   - Solve 2-3 beginner-level problems on LeetCode or HackerRank per topic.

2. **Problem Solving**  
   - Gradually increase problem difficulty.
   - Focus on **FAANG-frequent problems** and patterns.

3. **Time Complexity & Optimization**  
   - Understand time/space complexity of every DS operation.
   - Practice questions emphasizing optimization.

4. **Mock Interviews**  
   - Schedule mock coding interviews to apply your knowledge under pressure.
