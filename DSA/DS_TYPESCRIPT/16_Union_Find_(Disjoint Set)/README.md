## What is Union Find / Disjoint Set?

Union Find is a data structure designed to **manage a collection of disjoint (non-overlapping) sets** efficiently. Think of it like organizing people into different friend groups — initially, everyone is alone, but over time some people form friend groups (sets). Union Find helps track which people are in which friend group.

- **Disjoint Set** means the sets do not overlap — any element belongs to exactly one set.
- We want to quickly find which set an element belongs to.
- We want to quickly merge two sets when we find a connection between elements.

## Why Do We Use Union Find?

Imagine you have a network (like a social network, or cities connected by roads). You want to check if two people (or places) are connected, directly or indirectly, or merge their groups if they become connected.

Union Find is used because it supports these critical operations efficiently:

- **Find:** Check if two items are in the same group.
- **Union:** Combine two groups into one.

It's very useful in problems related to connectivity and grouping.

## How Does Union Find Work?

At its core, Union Find uses:

- An array called **parent** where `parent[i]` stores the parent (or leader) of item `i`.
- If `i` is the leader of its set, then `parent[i] = i`.

Two main operations:

1. **Find:** Follow the chain of parents to find the leader of the set for an element.
2. **Union:** Attach one set's leader to another set's leader to merge them.

### Optimization Techniques

- **Path Compression:** During a find operation, make each visited item point directly to the leader. This speeds up future finds.
- **Union by Rank/Size:** Always attach the smaller set’s leader under the larger set’s leader to keep the tree shallow.

## Time and Space Complexity

- **Time Complexity:** Almost constant $$O(\alpha(n))$$ per operation, where $$\alpha$$ is the inverse Ackermann function, which grows extremely slowly and can be treated as nearly constant.
- **Space Complexity:** $$O(n)$$ to store the parent array and optional rank or size arrays.

## Union Find in Practice: Example

Suppose we have 5 people: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4

- Initially: each person is in their own set: {0}, {1}, {2}, {3}, {4}

Union operations:

- Union(0, 1) → merge sets {0} and {1} → {0,1}
- Union(3, 4) → merge sets {3} and {4} → {3,4}

Find operations:

- Find(1) and Find(0) return the same leader → they are connected.
- Find(0) and Find(3) return different leaders → not connected.

## Interview Question Types with Union Find

- Finding connected components in undirected graphs
- Detecting cycles in graphs
- "Number of Islands" or connected regions in matrices
- Kruskal’s MST algorithm for minimum spanning trees
- Network connectivity and friend circles

## Using Union Find with Other Patterns

Union Find is often combined with:

- Graph algorithms (DFS, BFS)
- Sorting (like in Kruskal’s MST)
- Sometimes with search patterns in grids or union-find can be used as a helper structure in dynamic connectivity problems.
