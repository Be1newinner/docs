// Simple Problem: Merge Meeting Times
// Problem:
// You have a list of meeting time intervals represented as pairs [start, end]. Some meetings may overlap. Your task is to merge all overlapping meetings and return a list of merged meeting intervals.

// Example:
// Input: [[1][4], [2][5], [7][9]]
// Output: [[1][5], [7][9]]
// Explanation: The first two meetings overlap and merge into [1][5]. The third meeting does not overlap.

// Why This is a Good Practice for the Pattern
// Sort intervals by start time.

// Merge overlapping intervals in a single pass.

// Practice core logic of interval comparison and merging.

// Would you like to try solving it yourself with some guiding hints, or want me to provide a step-by-step solution in Typescript?Here is a simple problem directly solvable using the Overlapping Intervals pattern:
