**Chapter 3: Vector Databases - The Universal Semantic Search Engine**
_Exploring the specialized databases required to manage and query the "meaning" of your data._

- **3.1 What is a Vector?:** A practical refresher on embeddings as coordinates in a "meaning space."
- **3.2 The Nearest Neighbor Problem:** Why traditional databases fail at semantic search at scale.
- **3.3 The `pgvector` Starting Point:** Leveraging your existing PostgreSQL skills for vector search.
- **3.4 When to Scale:** An overview of dedicated vector databases (e.g., Pinecone, Weaviate) for production systems.
- **3.5 Multi-Modal Embeddings:** Understanding that vectors can represent images, audio, and text in a shared space, enabling cross-modal search.
